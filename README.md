## CDS Plugin Development Framework
CDS Plugin Development Framework is distributed as Microsoft Solution, which allows you to gain control over customer logic implemented in Microsoft Power Platform. The main bonus is in-depth diagnostic information presented in well-arranged dashboards.  The solution contains set of DLL libraries, which creates a middleware between standard Microsoft SDK and the customer logic. The logic is implemented as Tasks executed in a defined order. Each Task run produces detailed diagnostic information, which helps to track execution of the implemented logic and thus contributes to easy development and fast and effective trouble shooting.
