## CDS Plugin Development Framework
CDS Plugin Development Framework consists of a solution in CRM, which offers detailed diagnostic information in well-arranged dashboards.  Integrated into the solution, there is also a set of DLL libraries, which creates a middleware between standard Microsoft SDK and customer logic implementation. The logic is implemented as tasks launched in a defined order. Each task then generates diagnostic information, which helps to understand how the implemented logic behaves as well as contributes to quick development and efficient error corrections. 

Our methodology includes a procedure for analysis writing, source codes organizing, solutions testing, as well as automated deployment right from Microsoft Azure DevOps.

[Innovation One s.r.o](https://innone.cz/) with the support of CDS Plugin Development Framework can help you analyze your business issues and correctly set the methods of development tailor-made right to your needs.
